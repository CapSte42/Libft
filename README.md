# **Libft**
Your very first own library

## **Project overview**
The **Libft** project is one of the **foundational projects** in the **42 curriculum**.
It challenges students to create their **own library** of standard C functions, which they will use in future projects.
This project is designed to deepen the understanding of fundamental programming concepts, memory management, and the C standard library.

#### **Objective**
- **Reimplement Standard Library Functions**: Students recreate essential functions from the C standard library, such as strlen, strcpy, strcmp, and calloc.
- **Build Custom Utility Functions**: Beyond standard functions, students are encouraged to write custom utility functions to handle strings, linked lists, and memory operations.
- **Understand Memory Management**: By implementing functions like malloc, free, and calloc, students gain a deeper understanding of dynamic memory allocation.
- **Code Quality and Optimization**: Emphasis is placed on writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code.

#### **Key feature**
- **String Manipulation Functions**: Implementations of functions for handling and manipulating C strings.
- **Memory Functions**: Custom implementations of memory allocation and manipulation functions.
- **Linked List Functions**: Creation and management of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Custom Utility Functions**: Additional functions that facilitate common programming tasks.
